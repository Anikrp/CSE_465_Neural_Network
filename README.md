# CSE_465_Neural_Network
This is a Neural Network project  for course CSE_465.<br>
This project aims to compare the effectiveness of a custom CNN (Convolutional
Neural Network) and a Feedforward Network for image classification using a small
dataset from Tiny ImageNet. The dataset comprises 500-1000 images across ten distinct
categories. The objective is understanding which neural network architecture performs
better in scenarios with limited data.
Our primary goal is to conduct a comparative study between a custom CNN and a
Feedforward Network in the context of image classification using a limited dataset from
Tiny ImageNet. Firstly, we will curate a dataset consisting of 500-1000 images from Tiny
ImageNet, evenly distributed across ten distinct categories. Then we will design and
implement a custom CNN architecture and a Feedforward Network with a suitable
structure. To ensure optimal performance, the models will be fine-tuned using
regularization technique and validated to prevent overfitting. Subsequently, a crucial
phase involves testing the models on entirely new images that were not part of the
training set. The objective is to assess their classification accuracy and efficiency.
Through a detailed analysis of the results, we will gain insights into the comparative
effectiveness of these two models when dealing with a limited dataset. This study
contributes to a better understanding of their respective capabilities in image
classification tasks with constrained data availability.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) outperforms the Feedforward Neural Network
(FFN) in both test accuracy and test loss. CNN achieves a higher accuracy (76.00%
compared to 51.00% for FFN) and a lower test loss (1.0195 compared to 1.5004 for
FFN). By comparing the accuracy results of the custom CNN and the Feedforward
Network, we aim to draw conclusions that the CNN is better suited for tasks related to
image processing and pattern recognition.
